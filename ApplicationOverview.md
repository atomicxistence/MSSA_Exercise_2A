# Calculating Averages

### Sum of numbers
>Create a console application that will accept ten numbers between 0 and 100, and report their sum.  

```cs 
using Linq;

var numbers = new List<int>();
numbers.Sum();
```

### Average ten scores
>Create a console application that will accept ten test scores between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. For example, a teacher will input ten test scores and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.  

```cs
int Average(int sum, int amount)
string Grade(int gradeValue)
```

## Intermediate Difficulty
### Average a specific number of scores
>Create a console application that will accept an arbitrary number test scores (as specified by the user) between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. For example, a teacher will input the total number of tests, then input ten test scores and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.  

```cs
//no new methods needed
```

## Advanced Difficulty
### Average a non-specific number of scores
>Create a console application that will accept a number test scores (as calculated by the number of scores actually entered) between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. For example, a teacher will input any number test scores, and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.

```cs
//no new methods needed
```
